        Orgin of the Webserver
    </h2>
    <p>
        My cousin, a wonderful person, in the summer of 2020 gifted me a hardrive for
        my laptop that had linux on it. He also taught me some basic skills and encouraged
        me to try some of these things.
        I took a while to get around to it, but I finally made a webserver routed through
        a raspberry pi. This action was also motivated by the extra donation he promised to
        my High School Robotics Team. If anyone is curious, the team website can be found 
        <a href="https://www.frc3344.com/">here</a>.<br/>
