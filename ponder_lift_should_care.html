            Why Should People Believe I should Care?
        </h1>
        <p>
            In Food service, there is a Phrase thrown around that basically 
            declares the customer to be supreme. Well I believe the Customer is 
            full of bunk. There are many customers who are just fine and in 
            fact, are super cool. But the ones who believe they hold all the power.

            One lady, one time, yelled at me about a mistake the cashier made
            regarding Tomatos. I had not been informed of a Tomato Allergy and the lady
            was actually in the wrong. I did care, and when informed,I ordered my
            coworker on the line to change knives and gloves. But this lady yelled at
            me and eventually asked me for my name. I gave her a fake name, to get 
            her out of the store.

            Those kinds of people are simply seeking attention. To make me 
            quiver in my boots and bow down to them. Because to them, they 
            believe that all managers and bosses are afraid of them. That the 
            Customer is supreme. In some cases, to bend the knee is the only 
            way to keep an employee. But most employees, if they work hard and 
            present themselves as a good honest worker to their boss should 
            have nothing to fear.

            This customer is a type of ages old parasite: The shirker of duty 
            and work. For a good person is not the one who goes to Church and 
            hears of the golden rule, then tries to blackmail the workers into 
            giving them free food. The good person is the one who treats all 
            mistakes as all that, mistakes. For no one learns from a mistake 
            when they are unable to improve.
