      Contemplation, Abstraction, and Theorising on the Qualities of Leaders
    </h1>

      What is a leader?
    </h2>

    <p>
      Wikipedia defines Leadership as: 
      <blockquote>
        "Leadership, both as a research area and as a practical skill, 
        encompasses the ability of an individual, group or organization to "lead", 
        influence or guide other individuals, teams, or entire organizations."
      </blockquote>
      However, what does leadership <em>really</em> mean?
    </p>

    <p>
      Leadership in some eyes is seen as easy. Like one could simply peform it 
      as if riding a bike: Hard at first or if it has been a while, but easy 
      once you get going. I believe that is a misguided view of how life works. 
      Life is rarely so simple, with its hundreds of shades of grey, white, 
      and black.

  <p>Let's get some facts out of the way:</p>

  <ol>
    <li><b>A Good Leader can have a bad day</b>
    <li><b>A Bad Leader Can have a good day</b>
    <li><b>Judgement of leader should change</b>
    <li><b>People can change and have changed</b>
    <li><b>Never discount another's problems unless they do not seek change</b>
  </ol>

  <p>
    These should be the principles expected of all. One should not mistake a 
    few competent choices or actions for a good leader.A Good leader should try 
    to always help their people. They should also believe in an end goal or 
    something. They <em>don't</em> need to have extremely well laid plans. 
    A leader should be able to change to the situation quickly. To quote WW1 
    German General Luddendorf: "Punch a hole and let the rest follow." 
    You shouldn't commit to plans that must be followed down to the letter. 
    Have a good idea of an endgoal, but be willing to change. And take this 
    change and adapt.
